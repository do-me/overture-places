Data on Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/do-me/overture-places

For running locally, simply download the two files from HF and edit main.js where the files are loaded. More detailed instructions coming soon. 
The frontend code is messy and needs to be cleaned up. Probably won't find the time so feel free to submit a PR.
